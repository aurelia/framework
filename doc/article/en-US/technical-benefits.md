## [Modern JavaScript](aurelia-doc://section/1/version/1.0.0)

* Fully written in standards-based ES2015+ and TypeScript.
* Forward compatible with JavaScript technology coming in future ECMAScript specs.
* Full support for both Babel and TypeScript.

## [Modern DOM](aurelia-doc://section/2/version/1.0.0)

* Consistently leverages the most modern DOM APIs.
* Bare "to the metal" usage of the DOM; no DOM wrappers in order to ensure maximum performance and memory efficiency.
* Automatically polyfills the DOM where appropriate, in order to support older browsers.

## [Modern Tooling](aurelia-doc://section/3/version/1.0.0)

* Supports modern build tooling via the Aurelia CLI and Webpack, out-of-the-box.
* Works well with powerful testing tools like Karma and Protractor.
* Provides a custom Chrome debug panel as well as a VS Code plugin.

## [Code Quality](aurelia-doc://section/4/version/1.0.0)

* Source code is covered by an extensive suite of unit tests.
* All source is fully linted for style and feature-usage consistency throughout.
* TypeScript d.ts files and full API documentation are provided for all libraries.

## [Web Component Standards](aurelia-doc://section/5/version/1.0.0)

* Leverages W3C Web Components specs such as HTMLTemplateElement and ShadowDOM.
* Fully compatible with 3rd-party Web Components, even those originating from other frameworks, such as Polymer.
* Provides a Web Component-based programming model even on browsers that will never support Web Components.

## [Modularity](aurelia-doc://section/6/version/1.0.0)

* Highly modular development, suitable for small and large-scale apps alike.
* Native support for feature-based development facilitating parallel development of multiple teams on the same app.
* Strong component model for high re-use of UI components across apps.

## [Platform Support](aurelia-doc://section/7/version/1.0.0)

* Designed for modern web browsers but supports older browsers, such as IE9, via additional polyfills.
* Designed for mobile application development in combination with PhoneGap/Cordova/Crosswalk.
* Designed for desktop application development in combination with Electron or NWJS.

## [Capabilities](aurelia-doc://section/8/version/1.0.0)

    * Routing/Navigation
    * Modal Dialogs
    * Web Components
    * Progressive Enhancement
    * Custom scenarios enabled through low-level access to our View Composition Engine
* Fully-extensible View Compiler, View Engine and View Resource Pipeline.
* Fully-extensible and adaptive data-binding engine.
* Powerful and flexible hierarchical dependency injection.
* Eager/Lazy/Hybrid loading of any/all application resources.
* Powerful application router with support for encapsulated child routers for multi-team, large-scale development.
* Optionally create standards-compliant Web Components or use Aurelia to "shield" you from unstable specs.
* Interoperate with any standards-compliant Web Component.
* Loosely coupled cross-component communication via publish/subscribe.
* Fully customizable application startup and plugin model.
* Enables authoring of testable, maintainable and extensible code.
